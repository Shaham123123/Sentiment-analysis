This project implements a sentiment analysis tool that analyzes the sentiment of user-provided text and classifies it as positive, negative, or neutral.
It leverages the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) model, which is specifically tuned for sentiments expressed in social media.

The results of the sentiment analysis are not only displayed in text form but are also visualized using a pie chart, giving a clear overview of the sentiment distribution in the input data.

Key Features:
Input Text Analysis: The program accepts text input (such as user comments, reviews, or messages) and processes it to identify the sentiment.
Sentiment Classification: Each text is classified as Positive, Negative, or Neutral based on the compound score generated by the VADER sentiment analyzer.
Visual Representation: The program generates a pie chart that visually represents the distribution of sentiments across multiple texts

How It Works
Sentiment Detection:

The VADER sentiment analyzer processes each input text.
A compound sentiment score is calculated based on the text's positive, negative, neutral, and overall sentiment context.
Based on this score:
Texts with a score ≥ 0.05 are classified as Positive.
Texts with a score ≤ -0.05 are classified as Negative.
Texts with scores in between are classified as Neutral.
Visualization:

The program counts the number of positive, negative, and neutral classifications and visualizes these counts in a pie chart.
The pie chart helps provide a clear and intuitive visual summary of the sentiment distribution.
